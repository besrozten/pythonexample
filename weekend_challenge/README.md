## Missions

- Populate `encrypt(plain, key)` and `decrypt(encrypted, key)` functions body to apply Caesar cipher. It must work for printable characters of ASCII. Hint: [32, 126].

- Write `Dockerfile`.

- Create your branch, push your code, open a pull request, check test results (GitHub actions).

## Rules

- Variable and function names must be clear and in English.

- Helper functions should be written. Each function should do one job and do it well.

- Entire code should be clean and well-formatted.

- Dockerfile size should be less than 50 MB. 

- You should use git over terminal.

- Branch name must match pattern fix/{nameSurname}. Example: fix/ahmetSenharputlu

- Each function should be committed separately. Commit message is important and it should be clean, started with uppercase. Example: "Update Dockerfile"

- You should add a PR message that explains what this PR will add or fix.
